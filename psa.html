        11 signs of animal cruelty and how you can help - pets for Patriots </a></p>
      </h1>
      
    <p>Above, we have provided you with a few links on some horrific things that happen to animals. There are hundreds, if not thousands, incidents like these happening every day across the globe and in some countries it is much worse than we imagine. We want to raise awareness about this sensitive topic and to help, help as much as you can because every good deed counts. If we start the change within ourselves we'll be able to help others too. By looking at us other people will be inspired to help as well. We firmly believe abuse and cruelty is in no way acceptable. Our page is about loving and respecting every living creature. </p>
        <br>

      <p>  Some things that are worth thinking of: </p>
          
   <center>
      <p1>
          - We are all on this earth to live and be happy so, why not give that to every living species?
          <br>
          - We do not get to decide what function animals play in our lives whether it is for entertainment, nutrition, tests, apparel etc. What if it was the other way round?
          <br>
          - We are in no place to decide when their lives end.
          <br>
          - Animals have pure hearts; they have no intention of hurting you. We must do the same. 
          <br>
          - If you can't love a pet like a family memebr then don't get one!
          <br>
          <p1> - How could I let this happen?
