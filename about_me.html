<P>Hello, my name is Isabelle Tara Torab. I am half Persian and half Tatar. I was born in Los Angeles, California but in summer 2022 I moved to Brooklyn, New York. I love traveling, taking pictures, summer, animals, painting, dancing, shopping, cooking, and spending time with my loved ones. I have always wanted to pursure acting and become an actress or/and a movie director however, now  I am an aspiring graphic designer. I have joined the multimedia sphere recently and now I am hoping on making more, bigger and better projects. </P>
